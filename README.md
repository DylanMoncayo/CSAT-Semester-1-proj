Project Idea: Financial Portfolio Management Tool

I will create a web based application that helps the user manage their financial portfolio. It will provide tools for tracking investments, analyzing your performance, and making good financial decisions.

What it will include: Tracking portfolio. Allows the user to input their investments, socks, bonds, and other assets. Performance analytics. Create algorithms to calculate the performance metrics like overall risk, return on investment. Insight. Give recommendations based to manage risk. Simulation. Allow users to simulate changes in their portfolio or test different investment strategies. Data visualization. Make charts and graphs to give users a visual representation. Recommendations. Add machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and risk tolerance.

Possible ideas for later: Get AI linked in to it A chat bot to help the user.
